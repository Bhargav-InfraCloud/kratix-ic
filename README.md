Platform engineering is a struggle between off-the-shelf offerings that only
serve a small percentage of your applications and unmaintainable bespoke
solutions your teams build on Kubernetes… which only serve a small percentage of
your applications.

For even a moderately complex environment, this build vs buy
situation is lose-lose. We built Kratix, an open-source framework for building
platforms. Kratix makes it possible for you to stand up a platform (or many
platforms!) that is specific to your needs but easy to maintain and upgrade
because it’s built on the best of open-source and cloud offerings.
