# The Problem Kratix Solves

## The Value of Kratix

### A Platform Team can:
- Curate a bespoke platform API to offer a compelling Platform as a Product.
- Codify their organisation's policies and opinions (security, compliance, etc) into their as-a-Service software supply chain.
- Provide usable on-demand services composed from lower-level Kubernetes "operators".
- Use familiar Kubernetes tools and native constructs.
- Start small on a laptop and expand to multi-team multi-cluster multi-region multi-cloud with a consistent API everywhere.
- Discover and share on-demand multi-cluster software (Promises) with the Kratix ecosystem.

### A Steam-Aligned / Application Team can:
- Discover and consume the services in their organisation on-demand using standard Kubernetes APIs.
- Consume as-a-Service from the platform, safe in the knowledge that the service is fit for purpose in their organisation.
